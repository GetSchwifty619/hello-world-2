My fellow homo sapiens 


Today is June 21, 2018. Today I take my first serious leap into the coding world. I've had little exposure by friends and ultimately after many years of pondering and questioning I've decided to give it the time and dedication that this craft deserves. I go into this with a blind and fresh perspective. Let my human spirit spir me forward until I succeed in my goal and then some. No excuses, I will do this.
